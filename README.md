Mp3 Player For m5 Cardputer

StackChan came to liven up the cardputer's downtime when you're not using it for other things or when it's charging, and now it can groove to MP3s in the background.
This means that when the device is recharging, it won't have a static background, and now you can listen to music while enjoying StackChan's cuteness.
